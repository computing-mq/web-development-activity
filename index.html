        <h3>Fake News</h3>
        <p>This exercise is about modifying the content of a page in your web 
        browser using Javascript.&nbsp; As we have said, Javascript has access 
        to the current page via the Document Object Model or DOM.&nbsp; In your 
        browser, the variable <code>document</code> represents the current document 
        and your code can use it to read and write to the current page.&nbsp; In this 
        exercise we will use the developer tools Javascript console to write Javascript 
        to access parts of the main page of a newspaper site and, just for fun, 
        modify their contents. The instructions here relate to Chrome but some 
        variation will work in any browser.</p>

        <ol>
            <li>Go to the main page of a news website, I recommend 
                    <a href="https://www.petnews.com.au/" target="_blank">Pet Industry News</a>
                    or <a href="https://www.dailypaws.com/" target="_blank">The Daily Paws</a> (real
                    news is too depressing at the moment). Whatever site you choose 
                    should have headlines on the front page.</li>
            <li>Right click on one of the headlines and choose "Inspect"</li>
            <li>This should show you the HTML of the page with the element corresponding 
                to your headline highlighted. Take note of the kind of element 
                it is (eg. &lt;h3&gt;) and any class attributes it has. You will 
                use these to select this element in your Javascript code.</li>
            <li>Switch to the Console tab in developer tools</li>
        </ol>

        <p>The console allows you to run Javascript code in the context of the current page, 
            so the document variable will represent the page you are viewing.
            Write Javascript code to select all of the headline elements, so if you saw 
            that they were all &lt;h3&gt; elements you might write:</p>

        <pre>headlines = document.getElementsByTagName("h3")</pre>

        <p>Take the first of these and find the HTML content of the heading:</p>

        <pre>headlines[0].innerHTML</pre>

        <p>Now modify this to add your own message to the page</p>

        <pre>headlines[0].innerHTML = "COMP2110 Found to be Best Unit in the Universe!"</pre>

        <p>Check the page to see your updated headline.</p>

        <p>Ok, so we can fake the news, that's good but we can go further.</p>

        <ol>
        <li>Write a for loop that changes the content of all of the headlines 
            to your chosen message</li>
        <li>Write a function that takes your new message as an argument and 
            modifies the headlines when it is called</li><li>On Pet News at 
                least there are captions over some of the images - see if you can 
                target these too - look at the class names on the elements 
                containing the text.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>Now, be careful to only use your new-found powers for good, not evil.</p>
