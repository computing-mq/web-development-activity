                <h2>Web Development Activity</h2>
            </div>
        </header>

        <p>In this activity we will explore behind the scenes in your 
            web browser to look at the tools that web developers can use 
            when building web applications.  We'll look at Javascript, the 
            programming language of the web and how you can use it to
            modify a web page.
        </p>

        <h2>Your Browser Development Tools</h2>

        <p>You can <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/open/">open
            the developer tools
        </a> in Chrome (and most other browsers) by hitting F12.  
        (Do it now!)
        There are a number of tabs.  We'll mostly use
        the Elements and Console tabs for this activity.  
        </p>

        <h3>Elements</h3>
        <p>In the <i>Elements</i> tab you can view the structure of the HTML 
        page - this is the language that web pages are written in.  
        Take a look at the structure of this page.  Look for the paragraphs
        &lt;p&gt;, and headers &lt;h2&gt;.</p>

        <h3>Network</h3>

        <p>The <i>Network</i> tab let's you see the requests sent from your
        browser to the server and the response that comes back.  Select the 
        Network tab and reload the page.  You should see requests for the 
        page <i>web-development-activity/</i> but also for some other resources. 
        What do these other resources do?</p>

        <h3>Console</h3>

        <p>The <i>Console</i> tab lets you run commands and interact with 
        the web page that is loaded. It understands the 
        <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript">Javascript</a> 
        programming language.  Here's a simple command:</p>

        <pre>console.log('hello world!')</pre>

        <p>Javascript is able to access the web page that we're viewing and even
            make changes to it.  Here's a very destructive command.  After you try 
            this, it refresh to get the page back.
        </p>

        <pre>document.write('&lt;h1>where did the page go?&lt;/h1>')</pre>

        <p>The <code>document.write</code> command writes new text into the
        current web page, in this case, replacing the existing contents. 
        We can be more subtle than that, as we'll see in the next 
        exercise. </p>

        <h2>Fake News</h2>

        <p>This exercise is about modifying the content of a page in your web 
        browser using Javascript.  As we have said, Javascript has access 
        to the current page via the Document Object Model or DOM.  In your 
        browser, the variable <code>document</code> represents the current document 
        and your code can use it to read and write to the current page.  In this 
        exercise we will use the developer tools Javascript console to write Javascript 
        to access parts of the main page of a newspaper site and, just for fun, 
        modify their contents. The instructions here relate to Chrome but some 
        variation will work in any browser.</p>

        <ol>
            <li>Go to the main page of a news website, I recommend 
                    <a href="https://www.petnews.com.au/" target="_blank">Pet Industry News</a>
                    or <a href="https://www.dailypaws.com/" target="_blank">The Daily Paws</a> (real
                    news is too depressing at the moment). Whatever site you choose 
                    should have headlines on the front page.</li>
            <li>Right click on one of the headlines and choose "Inspect"</li>
            <li>This should show you the HTML of the page with the element corresponding 
                to your headline highlighted. Take note of the kind of element 
                it is (eg. &lt;h3&gt;) and any class attributes it has. You will 
                use these to select this element in your Javascript code.</li>
            <li>Switch to the Console tab in developer tools</li>
        </ol>

        <p>The console allows you to run Javascript code in the context of the current page, 
            so the document variable will represent the page you are viewing.
            Write Javascript code to select all of the headline elements, so if you saw 
            that they were all &lt;h3&gt; elements you might write:</p>

        <pre>headlines = document.getElementsByTagName("h3")</pre>

        <p>This code will create a variable called <code>headlines</code> that
        will hold the array of headline elements from the page.  We can then
        access these to find out what they are and even change them.</p>

        <aside>
            <h4>What is an Array?</h4>
            <p>An array is a programming data structure that stores a
                sequence of bits of data.   Your program can access these
                one after another in sequence or pull out one particular 
                element in the array.
            </p>
        </aside>

        <p>Take the first of these headlines and find the HTML content of the heading
            by using the square bracket notation.  Here 0 is the index 
            of the first element of the array:</p>

        <pre>headlines[0].innerHTML</pre>

        <p>Now modify this to add your own message to the page</p>

        <pre>headlines[0].innerHTML = "Macquarie Found to be Best University in the Universe!"</pre>

        <p>Check the page to see your updated headline.</p>

        <p>Ok, so we can fake the news, that's good but we can go further.</p>

        <h3>Looping</h3>

        <p>A loop in a programming language let's us do something 
            repeatedly.  A common use is to do something to every element
            in an array.  Here is an example loop:
        </p>

        <pre>
for (let index = 0; index < 10; index++) {
    console.log('around the loop', index);
}</pre>

        <p>This should output ten lines of text.</p>

        <p>Now, here's your challenge: </p>

        <p class="challenge">Write a for loop that changes the content of 
            <b>all of the headlines</b> in the page 
            to your chosen message</p>


        <p>Now, be careful to only use your new-found powers for good, not evil.</p>
